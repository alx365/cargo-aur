A AUR package generator, that generates (duh) aur packages of your rust applications.

Installation:
`cargo install cargo-makepkg`

Usage:
Run `cargo makepkg` in the root of your rust application.

If you haven't set the values, in the toml file, cargo-makepkg will ask you some questions, that you have to answer.

This will create a new folder in /target called aur-package with a MAKEPKG file.

You definitly should test this makepkg file with
```
cd target/aur-package
makepkg -si
```
And edit it to your needs.

All you now have to do, is push the git repo in that dir, onto the aur.


This is basically a fork of this: https://github.com/kstep/cargo-pkgbuild/
and similar to this:
https://github.com/fosskers/cargo-aur

The only difference to cargo-pkgbuild is that you don't have to have keep rust installed for it to work and the difference to cargo-aur is, that this isn't a binary package, but a source based one.
